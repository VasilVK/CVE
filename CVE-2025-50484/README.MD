# *CVE-2025-50484: Broken Access Control in PHPGurukul Small CRM v3.0*

## *Description*

A vulnerability was found in PHPGurukul Small CRM v3.0 in the component /crm/change-password.php file of the user panel - Change Password component. Improper handling of session data allows a Session Hijacking attack, exploitable remotely.

## *Steps to Reproduce (PoC)*

1. Navigate to the Change Password component (/crm/change-password.php) in the user panel and observe the session handling mechanism.
2. Inject or fix a known session ID by setting a predictable or captured session token in the browser before the victim logs in.
3. Once the victim authenticates using the same session ID, the attacker gains unauthorized remote access to the victimâ€™s account and can perform actions like changing the password.

## *Impact*

Improper session invalidation can lead to session hijacking, where attackers maintain access even after a password change. This may result in unauthorized data access, fraudulent actions, or privilege misuse. It also undermines user trust and violates secure session handling standards.
