# *CVE-2025-45949: Session Fixation in PHPGURUKUL User Registration & Login and User Management System V3.3*

## *Description*

 A critical vulnerability was found in PHPGurukul User Registration & Login and User Management System V3.3 in the /loginsystem/change-password.php file of the user panel - Change Password component. Improper handling of session data allows a Session Hijacking attack, exploitable remotely and leading to account takeover.

## *Steps to Reproduce (PoC)*

1. Navigate to the /loginsystem/change-password.php component in the user panel and set or predict a session ID manually (e.g., by fixing the PHPSESSID value in the request).
2. Send the fixed session ID to the victim (e.g., via a crafted link or forced session fixation).
3. When the victim logs in using the fixed session ID, the attacker, maintaining the same session, gains unauthorized access to the victimâ€™s account remotely and can perform actions such as changing the password.

## *Impact*

Session Fixation vulnerability affects Authentication and Session&nbsp;Management
